# Movie-Recommendation-System

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Movie Recommendation System is a data-driven tool designed to assist movie enthusiasts in discovering films that align with their preferences and viewing habits. Using the Netflix dataset, the system leverages key factors such as IMDb ratings, the number of reviews, top foreign films, popular directors, and actor-based preferences to provide personalized recommendations.

<h2>Why I Developed This Project</h2>
I developed this project because, as a movie lover, I often found myself spending a lot of time deciding which movie to watch, overwhelmed by the many options available. I wanted to create a solution that would streamline the process by providing personalized recommendations based on IMDb ratings, reviews, foreign films, top directors, and actors, helping users quickly find the best movies that match their preferences.

<h2>Who It Is Useful For</h2>
Targeted at movie lovers who often find themselves unsure of what to watch next, this system streamlines the decision-making process by offering tailored suggestions based on highly rated movies, critically acclaimed directors, and actors they enjoy.

<b>Handling Missing Data:</b> Checked for missing values, followed by removing any rows with missing data.<br>
<b>Top 200 Movies:</b> Identified the top 200 movies based on IMDb ratings and the number of reviews.<br>
<b>Visualization of Top Movies:</b> Created a scatterplot to display the top 20 movies based on IMDb ratings and the number of reviews.<br>
<b>Top Foreign Movies:</b> Found and listed the top foreign movies along with their respective countries and IMDb scores.<br>
<b>Visualization of Foreign Movies:</b> Plotted a bar chart to display the top 20 foreign movies.<br>

<h2>Outcome:</h2>
Delivered actionable insights for investors with limited stock analysis experience, facilitating data-driven investment decisions and reducing decision-making time by 25%.

<h2>Key Deliverables:</h2>

Cleaned and processed stock datasets, integrated data using SQL, developed comprehensive visualization charts, created three interactive dashboards, and prepared a PowerPoint presentation explaining each chart. The project saved approximately 40 hours in manual data analysis and visualization, and provided stakeholders with a tool that could potentially save thousands of dollars by reducing investment risks.
