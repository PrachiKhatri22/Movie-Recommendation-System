# Movie-Recommendation-System

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Movie Recommendation System is a data-driven tool designed to assist movie enthusiasts in discovering films that align with their preferences and viewing habits. Using the Netflix dataset, the system leverages key factors such as IMDb ratings, the number of reviews, top foreign films, popular directors, and actor-based preferences to provide personalized recommendations.

<h2>Why I Developed This Project</h2>
I developed this project because, as a movie lover, I often found myself spending a lot of time deciding which movie to watch, overwhelmed by the many options available. I wanted to create a solution that would streamline the process by providing personalized recommendations based on IMDb ratings, reviews, foreign films, top directors, and actors, helping users quickly find the best movies that match their preferences.

<h2>Who It Is Useful For</h2>
Targeted at movie lovers who often find themselves unsure of what to watch next, this system streamlines the decision-making process by offering tailored suggestions based on highly rated movies, critically acclaimed directors, and actors they enjoy.
